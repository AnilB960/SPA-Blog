        <h1>People that I ADMIRE</h1>
        <p>Whether it’s a writer whose blog posts are always relatable, a public speaker whose workshops are always on-point,
          or a big name in your industry you’ve always looked up to,
          we all have people out there we admire and would like to reach out to just to say,&nbsp;
          <span className="special-text">“Hey, you’re great.”.</span>
        </p>
        <img src={require('./images/admire.png')}></img>
        <p>Everyone have their own favourite personalities whom they really admire with pure heart.
          Yes, I admire few people but these three tops the list.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>PAWAN KALYAN</li>
          <li>M. S. DHONI</li>
          <li>A. P. J. ABDUL KALAM</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>PAWAN KALYAN</h2>
        <p>
          Can a person's name have synonyms? Everyone say "NO". But, there is one name for which you can have
          apt synonyms like <span className="special-text">"Honest", "Simplicity", "Uniqueness"&nbsp;
          </span>&nbsp;and upon all&nbsp;
          <span className="special-text">"Great Human Being"</span>&nbsp;
          and its PAWAN KALYAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, he is an actor who was introduced as brother of Megastar Chiranjeevi.
          He worked hard and with a lot of dedication, he gained a huge fan base across the Telugu states in India. PAWANISM means more than a
          religion for fans. But, he never had complete satisfaction and happiness in movies or artistic world.
          Though, I never admired him as an actor.
        </p>
        <p> But a big announcement on March 14, 2014 has made by Pawan that he is into the politics and
           named party as JANASENA which means People's Army.
          </p>
        <p>Since then I am big fan/devotee of PAWAN KALYAN as a politician and leader. His ideologies and speeches inspired me a lot.</p>
        <img src={require('./images/pk.jpg')}></img>
        <p>
          I wonder why people say, "he is new to politics, how can one believe a person who has no experience".
          But the fact is - "No one has 0.0001 seconds of experience when he/she for the first time".
          I really motivated by his few statements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"I'm Indian. I can die for my Motherland."</li>
          <li>"In the end, I could be a fist mud, but I have snobbery that a country flag has."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If I get a chance of being another person, then definitely I would choose to be PAWAN KALYAN and serve/die for my country/people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am waiting for that day - Pawan Kalyan as Chief Minister and serving the people like nobody in history.
          One day, he is definitely going to change the political system in India. And I strongly believe in that. I am hoping the day is not far.
        </p>
        <h2>M. S. DHONI</h2>
        <p>
          <span className="special-text">“Dhoni finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd!
        India lift the World Cup after 28 years!</span>
          &nbsp;And it's and Indian captain, who has been absolutely magnificent on the night of the final", says Ravi Shatri on April 2, 2011.
          This is the most loved and goosbumbs scene for any Indian on the occassion of second Cricket World Cup Win (2011).
        </p>
        <p>
          Every leader is remembered in history for one decision of courage and wisdom that changes the
          course of history. Mahendra Singh Dhoni's greatness lies in the fact that with his guts,
           instincts and courage, he wrote, rewrote and even dictated the flow of history almost at will.
           On many occasions, it seemed, he was a master, conducting a cricket match with his bat and gloves
           as the baton.
        </p>
        <img src={require('./images/dhoni.jpg')}></img>
        <p>
          Everyone call him MR.COOL/Captain Cool. A rare mix of calmness, courage, self-belief and a gambler's instinct – factors that made me big fan of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He makes the things possible from an impossible situation.
          There are many situations of this kind and let me put one of my favourite.
          </p>
        <p>
          It is 25 March, 2016. India are being mocked and ridiculed by Mushfiqur Rahim with cheeky shots and
          raucous celebrations in the World T20. But as is always the case with Dhoni, luck intervenes.
          Rahim commits harakiri and Bangladesh are left with two to score of the last ball of the match.
          Enter Dhoni and his now predictable unpredictability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as Hardik Pandya runs in, Dhoni removes his gloves. Then, collecting a shoulder high ball,
          sprints towards the wickets and throws them down. A few seconds later – which look like eons –
          the third umpire confirms that Dhoni beat both the batsman and Bangladesh by just a few inches,
          perhaps centimetres.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="special-text">DHONI: 7</span> has huge fan base acroos the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          An year ago, MS Dhoni received the Padma Bhushan,
               the third highest civilian award in India. It was clear that he received this for his
               outstanding services to cricket, since he has arguably been India's best ever captain. Under his reign,
               India won every single ICC event possible: the T20 World Cup, ODI World Cup and the Champions Trophy.

        <h2>
          A. P. J. ABDUL KALAM
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span className="special-text">
            "Be more dedicated to making solid achievements than in running after swift but synthetic happiness,"</span>
          &nbsp;these are a few words of the late A. P. J Abdul Kalam.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man who will forever reign in our hearts as the 'People's President'.
            He had been an inspiration throughout his life, be it through his deeds or through his words.
            He was one of the most down to earth people ever and was loved and praised for his humility not only in
            India but throughout the world. After a single term of presidency, he returned to his normal life as a teacher.
            Dr. Kalam tragically passed away while delivering a lecture at Indian Institute of Management, Shillong.
            Here are a few facts that highlight the magnanimity of the man and why he will rule our hearts forever.

          Things that made Dr APJ Abdul Kalam the Most Extra Ordinary Man I Know
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Born on October 15, 1931, Kalam came from a humble background.
            He sold newspapers to support his family financially when he was a kid.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dr. Kalam is known as the father
            of Indian Missile Technology and has played a prominent role in India’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests.
          </li>
          <li>
            He brought dignity to whatever he did. Even politics!
          </li>
          <li>
            Before becoming the president, Dr.
            Kalam worked as an Aerospace Engineer with DRDO and ISRO. He was called the “Missile Man” of India.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dr. Kalam was much more than a political figure. He was a scientist, writer,
            inspirational speaker and motivational figure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dr. Kalam’s infectious personality had not just inspired Indians but also people across the globe.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kalam was nominated for Youth Icon of the Year award by MTV in 2003 and 2006.
            His age was 73 and 76 respectively then.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1998, he along with cardiologist Dr Soma Raju developed a low-cost coronary stent.
            It was later named ‘Kalam-Raju Stent’ in their honour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dr. Kalam had received several awards and recognition for
            his extra ordinary contribution to scientific research and modernization of defense technology in India.
