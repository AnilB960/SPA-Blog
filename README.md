This is for simple blog page that uses REACT.

I have used Node.js dependency.

Steps to run

1. You must install the node.js
   Link: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Open command prompt (or any equivalent to that)
3. Change the directory to the folder where all code present
  Example: cd desktop\blog
4. Install npm - this creates node_modules folder which are required
  Command: npm install
5. Run command - "npm start" to run react app
